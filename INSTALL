INSTALLATION
============

VoIPTool has only been tested on Linux. This does not mean it won't work on other
systems, but your milage may vary on getting it up and running.


PREREQUISITES.

This library is an add-on to the INET Framework for OMNeT++. It requires a working
installation of OMNeT++ 4.1 or later, and INET Framework version 20100723.

VoIPTool requires a "devel" package of the avcodec library (part of FFmpeg) 
to be installed on your system. On Ubuntu, this package can be installed with the 
following command:

$ sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev

The package name and installation command may vary for other Linux systems.


INSTALLATION USING THE OMNeT++ IDE.

Start the IDE, and make sure you have a working INET Framework installation 
as a project named "inet".

Import the VoIPTool project into the IDE (File->Import->General->Existing 
project into workspace), and make sure it has the "inet" project marked
as dependency (Project->Properties->Project References).

Hit Ctrl+B to build.

Run the example simulations to check everything works fine.

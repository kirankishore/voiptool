This is the Readme file of the OMNeT_VoIPTool_INET simulation.

Prerequisites
=============

1) In order to use our VoIP traffic generation and evaluation tool you
need to download and install a working OmNET++ version (3.1 or higher)
from http://www.omnetpp.org

(note that for OmNET++ to run, you will also have to download the 
appropriate TK and TCL libraries and set your environment variables
accordingly in your, e.g. in '.bashrc' set:
 
------------
export OMNET=<the path to your omnet installation>
export PATH=$OMNET/bin:$PATH

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$OMNET/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

export TCL_LIBRARY=/usr/share/tcl/tcl8.4  # Change if necessary
-------------- ).

2) This version is build with the INET framework. Thus, to be able to run
this simulation you need to download and build the INET framework
(also available on the omnet homepage, http://www.omnetpp.org/ ).

3) If you want to evaluate the VoIP transmission using ITU-T's P.862
PESQ tool, you need to download and install it as well.
The P.862 standard in combination with the evaluation tool source code
is available at the ITU homepage http://www.itu.int.

Note that, since you are reading this README file, we assume that you
have download our VoIP traffic generation and evaluation tool 
from http://www.tkn.tu-berlin.de/research/research.html
If not, download and unzip it calling 'tar xvzf OMNeT_VoIPTool_INET.tgz'
on a Linux shell, or using an arbitrary archive manager.


Installation
============

1) Once the archive file is downloaded and decompressed, switch to the
just created 'OMNeT_VoIPTool_INET' directory.

2) Open the shell script makemake.sh with any text editor, and edit
the following line concering your system:
INET="/path/to/your/INET"

3) Execute the shell script makemake.sh, which generates a Makefile
that includes all necessary libraries (using the opp_makemake command).
Calling makemake.sh will also set links to the codec libraries, which
are stored in the libs\ folder. It will further create the script you need to execute
to run the simulation (InetVoIPTest).

4) Type 'make' to compile the generator code.

5) If the compilation was successful, a dynamic library 'OMNeT_VoIPTool_INET.so'
has been created. The generator is started by executing the script 'InetVoIPTest'.

Note that, opp_makemake names the output file (here, the name of
the dynamic library) according to the name of the folder the command is executed in.
Thus, if you move the files to another folder, the library will have a different name.
If you choose to move the files to another folder, you need to modify the file omnetpp.ini:
The name of the library to load must be specified (without
the .so extension) in the line "load-libs =" in the General section.

Note that if you want to use ITU-T's PESQ evaluation tool, the 
executable file 'pesq' must be stored in the 'OMNeT_VoIPTool_INET' directory.
